    <h1>Docling Document Parsing: Techniques and Implementations</h1>
    <p>In the realm of data extraction and understanding documents, parsing becomes critical. Docling offers robust tools to facilitate this, providing various models to tackle document parsing efficiently.</p>
    <h2>Understanding Docling</h2>
    <p>Docling is designed to streamline the extraction and transformation of data from complex documents to structured formats. With a user-friendly interface and powerful models, it allows developers to enhance their applications.</p>
    <h2>Different Models in Document Parsing</h2>
    <h3>Table Transformers</h3>
    <p>Table Transformers play a significant role in extracting tabular data from documents. They utilize advanced techniques to read and interpret tables efficiently.</p>
    <h4>Implementation Example</h4>
    <pre><code>function extractTableData(document) {
    const tables = document.getElementsByTagName("table");
    return Array.from(tables).map(table => {
        const rows = Array.from(table.rows);
        return rows.map(row => Array.from(row.cells).map(cell => cell.innerText));
    });
}</code></pre>
    <h3>Other Parsing Models</h3>
    <p>In addition to Table Transformers, Docling employs various other models suitable for different structures and content types. These models adapt to different types of documents and can be customized as needed.</p>
    <h4>Code Snippet Example</h4>
    <pre><code>function parseDocument(doc) {
    // Basic parsing logic
    const data = {}; // initialize structure
    // custom parsing logic here
    return data;
}</code></pre>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Docling provides a dynamic approach to document parsing, with models like Table Transformers that enhance data extraction capabilities. With the right implementation, these tools can lead to efficient processing of data, facilitating better decision-making.</p>
